        "For iterative optimization algorithms like gradient descent, increasing the number of iterations allows the model to converge towards a local or global minimum.\n",
        "Initially, increasing the number of iterations generally improves the model's performance on the training dataset. However, after a certain point, it might lead to overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data.\n",

        "If by iterations, you mean repeatedly sampling and evaluating the model (like in repeated k-fold cross-validation or bootstrapping), then increasing the number of iterations can indeed give a better and more robust estimate of the model's performance.\n",
        "The more iterations (or resamples) you have, the more scenarios you test the model against, leading to a more generalized and less noisy estimate of its performance.\n",
        "In both contexts, there's a balance to strike. In model training, you want to avoid overfitting by iterating too much."
